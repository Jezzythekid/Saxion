# Introduction to programming.
Q1/Q2 of 2023/2024

The first programming class of the study teached us how to basic write programs in C.

It adressed:

- Variables and datatypes
- Arrays
- For and while loops
- Functions
- Strings and Pointers
- File management (#include, headerfiles)
- Arduino

## Notes

- Each week there were about 4 assignments to do. Each assignment was worth an x amount of points and you had to pick the assignments that summed up to 8 points per week (mostly the last and second to last were enough).
- `functions.h` and `functions.c` are headerfiles that were provided for us to use in our assignments. These were **not** written by me, buy the teacher.
